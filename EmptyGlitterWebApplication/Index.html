                    How wasteful of web space am I here? I think very. This is a simple,
                    one page application, that does nothing other than prove I can put things
                    on the web. So we shall daven that this shall work, and hopefully get
                    onto the web, and then we get to make a site that is less of a waste than
                    this one! How awesome is that!

                    Also, processing, we may as well make this educational! So here I will tell you the
                    reasoning behind the name. At first it was just Emptiness, because this site is so
                    worthless that it may as well be empty. Then, on Netlify, from where this thing deported,
                    the name they put as a placeholder value for the site was GlitteryUnicorns. So I wasn't
                    going to do that, but I did like the glitter part. And then I realized the significance!
                    You know those things that seem so shiny and fun and exciting, but really they're worthless?
                    Like this site? So it's glittery, and empty, how perfect!
